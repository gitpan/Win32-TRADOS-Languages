Win32-TRADOS-Languages

This module (and the utility script that calls it) write Registry
values that change the currently installed languages for TRADOS 2007.
This builds on the Registry-editing technique and table of language
codes that have been available on the Internet since at least 2009,
and makes it reliable and convenient to use the Registry editing
technique, instead of de-installing and re-installing TRADOS with
the new selection of languages.

In its simplest form, you can simply call:

   ttx-lang

at the Windows command prompt to see the languages installed, or

   ttx-lang -i

to start an interactive session allowing you to edit them.
